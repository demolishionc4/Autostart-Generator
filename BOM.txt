IMPORTANT INFO: The 4 way relay I got has NormOpen side be actually HIGH and to enable set to LOW. This way if the board or a wire becomes disconnected then you dont have relays enabled and burning out say your starter. This also saves wear on your relay module since you dont need to energize your relays to open the circuit. So set to HIGH to disengage relay (no power) and LOW to engage relay (with power).
